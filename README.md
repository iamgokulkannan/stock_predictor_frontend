Frontend - Stock Predictor UI (React.js)

This is the frontend for the Stock Predictor project. It communicates with a FastAPI backend to provide real-time stock predictions powered by ML models.

------------------------------------------------------------

üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

npm install

2. Start the development server:

npm run dev

(If you're using Create React App, use: npm start)

------------------------------------------------------------

üîó Backend API Integration

This frontend expects the backend to be running at http://localhost:8000

Create a .env file in the root of your frontend directory with:

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

In your code, you can use:

const BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
